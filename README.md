✈️ Flight Price Prediction – Supervised Machine Learning Project
This project involves predicting flight ticket prices using supervised machine learning techniques. The dataset includes features such as airline name, departure and arrival times, duration, number of stops, and source/destination cities. The data was preprocessed by handling null values, converting categorical features using label encoding and one-hot encoding, and transforming datetime fields. Various regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost were applied and compared based on performance metrics such as R² score and Mean Absolute Error. The goal is to build an accurate and reliable model that can help users estimate ticket prices before booking.
